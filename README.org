#+title: Mongoose

This library contains Common Lisp bindings to the [[https://mongoose.ws][Mongoose]] web server / client
library written in C.

This library has no Common Lisp dependencies, and Mongoose itself is also
entirely self-contained.

* Performance

See =sample.c= for a trivial baseline server and =repl.lisp= for its Common Lisp
analogue. The following command:

#+begin_example
echo "GET http://localhost:8000/html" | vegeta attack -duration=10s -rate=0 -max-workers=4 | tee results.bin | vegeta report
#+end_example

produces these results on my 2018 ThinkPad (I write this in January 2026). The
only attempt to optimize the C was to disable logging.
